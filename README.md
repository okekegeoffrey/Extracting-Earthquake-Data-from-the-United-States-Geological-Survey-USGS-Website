# Extracting-Earthquake-Data-from-the-United-States-Geological-Survey-USGS-Website
In this project, I am expected to use Python to access the United States Geological Survey free API and download real-time earthquake events.
This is a great exercise for learning how to use Python to send requests to a REST API and get data in return.
